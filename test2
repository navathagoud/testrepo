Git Revert :-
‘revert’ is the command we use when we want to take a previous 
commit and add it as a new commit, keeping the log intact. First thing, we 
need to find the point we want to return to. To do that, we need to go 
through the log. To avoid the very long log list, use the --oneline option 
which gives just one line per commit showing –
i. The first seven characters of the commit hash
ii. The commit message
